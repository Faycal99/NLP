       "'Wow... Loved this place. Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it. The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices. Honeslty it didn\\'t taste THAT fresh.) The fries were great too. A great touch. Service was very prompt. Highly recommended. The food, amazing. Service is also cute. I could care less... The interior is just beautiful. That\\'s right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good. This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff. Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed. Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal. seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive. Ample portions and good prices. My first visit to Hiro was a delight! There is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again. On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service. The burger is good beef, cooked just right. My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing. We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside. Their chow mein is so good! The portion was huge! Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu. The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant. The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked. The cocktails are all handmade and delicious. We are so glad we found this place. Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount. Always a great time at Dos Gringos! Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing We got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy. A great way to finish a great. - Really, really good rice, all the time. It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk. The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well. Today is the second time I\\'ve been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good. There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company. walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating. The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old. I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try. All I have to say is the food was amazing!!! Everything was fresh and delicious! Best breakfast buffet!!! Food arrived quickly! On the up side, their cafe serves really good food. Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go! The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary\\'s coming. Best Buffet in town, for the price you cannot beat it. I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious. This is one of the better buffets that I have been to. So we went to Tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon! The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal! The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing. Sooooo good!! REAL sushi lovers, let\\'s be honest - Yama is not that good. This is a really fantastic Thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit. Nice, spicy and tender. Good prices. It was pretty gross! I\\'ve had better atmosphere. Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did. Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing. Service was fine and the waitress was friendly. The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he\\'s ever eaten. We thought you\\'d have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night. Host staff were, for lack of a better word, BITCHES! Phenomenal food, service and ambiance. Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I\\'m in Vegas. Penne vodka excellent! They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers. Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even. Great Subway, in fact it\\'s so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations. This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas. He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas. My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions. The waiter wasn\\'t helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us. And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn\\'t very tasty to me. Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food. The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated. We watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us. My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away. This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay. Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here! the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean. this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored. I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I\\'d had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago. this place is good. Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced. Restaurant is always full but never a wait. DELICIOUS!! This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area. So don\\'t go there if you are looking for good food... This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed. The waitresses are very friendly. Everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter. The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness. Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor. I ordered the Lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible. The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined. Interesting decor. What I really like there is the crepe station. Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good. you can watch them preparing the delicious food!) Both of the egg rolls were fantastic. I had a salad with the wings, and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied. I\\'m not really sure how Joey\\'s was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine. The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho! The live music on Fridays totally blows. I\\'ve never been more insulted or felt disrespected. Very friendly staff. It is worth the drive. I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of. Food was great and so was the serivce! The warm beer didn\\'t help. Great brunch spot. Service is friendly and inviting. Very good lunch spot. I\\'ve lived here since 1979 and this was the first (and last) time I\\'ve stepped foot into this place. If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen. My friend loved the salmon tartar. Waitress was good though! The Jamaican mojitos are delicious. - the food is rich so order accordingly. The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don\\'t mind being nude for everyone to see! I loved the bacon wrapped dates. The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special. This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!! This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again. Very very fun chef. Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV\\'s. I\\'d say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M\\'s dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing). Everyone is very attentive, providing excellent customer service. Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas. Owner\\'s are really great people.! The Greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful. Overall, I don\\'t think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too. Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty. We had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast. Fantastic service here. I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water. The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite. Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot! The seafood was fresh and generous in portion. Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time. Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago! Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff. The chefs were friendly and did a good job. I\\'ve had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho. I liked the patio and the service was outstanding. The goat taco didn\\'t skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR! I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again. I went to Bachi Burger on a friend\\'s recommendation and was not disappointed. Great Pizza and Salads! We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home. This place is amazing! Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did! The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection. I didn\\'t know pulled pork could be soooo delicious. You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care. I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it. The food was excellent and service was very good. Good beer & drink selection and good food selection. Good Service-check! In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful. I did not expect this to be so good! Fantastic food! The food was very good. Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made. By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn\\'t mind making it publicly and loudly known. Back to good BBQ, lighter fare, reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways. And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can\\'t go wrong. Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews. A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal. Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!! The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL! They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good. I go to far too many places and I\\'ve never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00. Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back. We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere. I love this place. Great service and food. There is nothing authentic about this place. the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever. Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great. The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai. It\\'s worth driving up from Tucson! Pretty good beer selection too. This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER. Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!! I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious. Everyone is treated equally special. It was delicious!!! On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat. As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious! Best fish I\\'ve ever had in my life! (The bathroom is just next door and very nice.) This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted. Pretty cool I would say. Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table. The staff are great, the ambiance is great. They dropped more than the ball. The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable. They will customize your order any way you\\'d like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it! And the beans and rice were mediocre at best. Best tacos in town by far!! In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing. They have great dinners. WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED. If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place. I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area. I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great. We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience. Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria. To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser. Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos! Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see. Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable. Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area. Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible. Food was really good and I got full petty fast. Service was fantastic. I don\\'t know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea. Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed! But now I was completely grossed out. I really enjoyed eating here. First time going but I think I will quickly become a regular. Our server was very nice, and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs, he stayed professional and friendly until the end. From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste. On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop. This is some seriously good pizza and I\\'m an expert/connisseur on the topic. Strike 2, who wants to be rushed. We loved the biscuits!!! Service is quick and friendly. So absolutley fantastic. Wow very spicy but delicious. I\\'d love to go back. Anyway, this FS restaurant has a wonderful breakfast/lunch. Nothing special. Each day of the week they have a different deal and it\\'s all so delicious! The food is delicious and just spicy enough, so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way. My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor. The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc. Nargile - I think you are great. Best tater tots in the southwest. We loved the place. The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough. Im in AZ all the time and now have my new spot. The inside is really quite nice and very clean. The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable. Love the margaritas, too! This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint. Very good, though! Great pork sandwich. Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee. We enjoy their pizza and brunch. The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked. We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully. I LOVED it! This place is a jewel in Las Vegas, and exactly what I\\'ve been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here. Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh. The selection of food was not the best. Delicious and I will absolutely be back! This isn\\'t a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment. They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle. It was attached to a gas station, and that is rarely a good sign. How awesome is that. I will be back many times soon. The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide! CONCLUSION: Very filling meals. The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that. This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious! Waitress was sweet and funny. I also had to taste my Mom\\'s multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious! Cant say enough good things about this place. The ambiance was incredible. The waitress and manager are so friendly. Overall I wasn\\'t very impressed with Noca. I don\\'t each much pasta, but I love the homemade /hand made pastas and thin pizzas here. Give it a try, you will be happy you did. By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had! Reasonably priced also! Everything was perfect the night we were in. The food is very good for your typical bar food. At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff. first time there and might just be the last. Those burgers were amazing. Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for. This was my first time and I can\\'t wait until the next. The bartender was also nice. Everything was good and tasty! The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun. If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place. An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman. Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts. The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC. I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas! The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh. Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually. Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back! not even a \"hello, we will be right with you.\" My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service. Nice ambiance. However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good. I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here! All of the tapas dishes were delicious! A good time! I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi. Generous portions and great taste. The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an \"Are you being helped?\" Food was delicious! Eew... This location needs a complete overhaul. He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service. Our server was super nice and checked on us many times. The pizza tasted old, super chewy in not a good way. Service was good and the company was better! The staff are also very friendly and efficient. As for the service: I\\'m a fan, because it\\'s quick and you\\'re being served by some nice folks. If you look for authentic Thai food, go else where. Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting. My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar. Great place fo take out or eat in. The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options. It was a pale color instead of nice and char and has NO flavor. I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded. I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast. We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived. They also have the best cheese crisp in town. Good value, great food, great service. Couldn\\'t ask for a more satisfying meal. The food is good. It was awesome. !....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one! An absolute must visit! The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing. Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star. They really want to make your experience a good one. Pretty awesome place. Ambience is perfect. Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management. The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby! Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat ! The roast beef sandwich tasted really good! Ordered burger rare came in we\\'ll done. I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable. After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods. This is a good joint. The Macarons here are insanely good. Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative. Food was average at best. Great food. Great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer. It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends. The patio seating was very comfortable. Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant! That just SCREAMS \"LEGIT\" in my book...somethat\\'s also pretty rare here in Vegas. The atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested. I personally love the hummus, pita, baklava, falafels and Baba Ganoush (it\\'s amazing what they do with eggplant!). Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM! The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous. Both great! The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had. The staff was very attentive. What a great double cheeseburger! Awesome service and food. A fantastic neighborhood gem !!! It\\'s a great place and I highly recommend it. Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me. Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing. Very good food, great atmosphere.1 Damn good steak. Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo. The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant. The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had! Good food , good service . It was absolutely amazing. I probably won\\'t be back, to be honest. The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well. Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I\\'ve tried so far and they\\'re all good. Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more. I wasn\\'t really impressed with Strip Steak. Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!! Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff. The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me. The atmosphere here is fun. Service is quick and even \"to go\" orders are just like we like it! That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased. I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza. Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough! They have a really nice atmosphere. Cute, quaint, simple, honest. The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside. The food was great as always, compliments to the chef. Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy. Awesome selection of beer. Great food and awesome service! One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn\\'t expect more tip than that. A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!! As for the service, I thought it was good. The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us. Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service. I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper. The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it. When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way. There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat. Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette. Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn\\'t over-whelm the soup. We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC! Main thing I didn\\'t enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up. This is a GREAT place to eat! The jalapeno bacon is soooo good. The service was poor and thats being nice. Food was good, service was good, Prices were good. I\\'m so happy to be here!!!\" The block was amazing. It\\'s close to my house, it\\'s low-key, non-fancy, affordable prices, good food. * Both the Hot & Sour & the Egg Flower Soups were absolutely 5 Stars! Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night. The flair bartenders are absolutely amazing! These were so good we ordered them twice. I had a pretty satifying experience. Join the club and get awesome offers via email. Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder. Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat. The chains, which I\\'m no fan of, beat this place easily. I don\\'t have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well. The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff. Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service. When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there. Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid\\'s meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal. The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic. So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night. The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh. This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Once you get inside you\\'ll be impressed with the place. I\\'m super pissd. And service was super friendly. This place was such a nice surprise! They were golden-crispy and delicious. Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food. Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered. The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was. The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place! This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED! I love this place. The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree. This place should honestly be blown up. Do not waste your money here! I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes. The service here is fair at best. I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services. No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it. Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day. They were excellent. Just had lunch here and had a great experience. I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor. for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food. The food came out at a good pace. I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad. In fact I\\'m going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome. the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit. So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat. The price is reasonable and the service is great. My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn\\'t look too appealing. Went in for happy hour, great list of wines. This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant. Talk about great customer service of course we will be back. I love their fries and their beans. This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer. The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table. The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best. All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting. My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience. I\\'ve had better bagels from the grocery store. I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude! Now the burgers aren\\'t as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless. We definately enjoyed ourselves. I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs. I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service. The pizza selections are good. I had strawberry tea, which was good. Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron! Overall, a great experience. Their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter... Mmmm...! The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated. The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot. I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. There is really nothing for me at postinos, hope your experience is better They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no! Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree. However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible. I could barely stomach the meal, but didn\\'t complain because it was a business lunch. We aren\\'t ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don\\'t get it...definitely lost the love after this one! The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn\\'t worth it. The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork. The building itself seems pretty neat, the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn\\'t eat here again. It was a bit too sweet, not really spicy enough, and lacked flavor. Maybe it\\'s just their Vegetarian fare, but I\\'ve been twice and I thought it was average at best. It wasn\\'t busy at all and now we know why. The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits. Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it. It\\'s NOT hard to make a decent hamburger. We\\'ve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant. The ambiance isn\\'t much better. The food wasn\\'t good. We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn\\'t fresh. It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant. The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables). It really is impressive that the place hasn\\'t closed down. The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we\\'ll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.'"
